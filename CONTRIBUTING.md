Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Rewind**! We welcome contributions, bug reports, documentation improvements, and feature proposals.

## 🔒 The Non-Negotiable Rule: Zero Dependencies

Rewind is built with **100% standard library built-ins** and **ZERO third-party runtime or development dependencies**.

When contributing:
1. **Never add third-party dependencies** to `package.json` (`dependencies` and `devDependencies` must remain strictly empty `{}`).
2. Use Node.js standard built-ins (`node:fs`, `node:path`, `node:crypto`, `node:child_process`, `node:os`, `node:readline`, `node:stream`, `node:assert`).
3. Document any new standard library package replacements in [`STDLIB.md`](./STDLIB.md).

## 🛠️ Development Setup

No `npm install` is needed. You only need **Node.js >= 20.0.0**:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Tejas3479/rewind-cli.git
cd rewind

# 2. Run the test suite
npm test
# (or directly: node --test)

# 3. Verify zero dependencies
npm run check

# 4. Verify deterministic reproducible build
npm run build
npm run verify:build
```

## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

Rewind maintains rigorous test coverage using the native Node.js test runner (`node:test`) and assertion library (`node:assert/strict`):

* Every new feature or bugfix **must include automated unit/integration tests** in `test/`.
* All tests must execute cleanly with `node --test` without timeouts or flaky failures.
* Tests should clean up any temporary directories or ledger test files in `afterEach` / `after` hooks.

2. Implement your changes adhering to standard ES module conventions.
3. Add comprehensive tests in `test/`.
4. Run the entire test suite and verify all tests pass:
   ```bash

   ```
5. Open a Pull Request referencing any relevant issues.
