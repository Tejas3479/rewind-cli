## ⚡ The Problem: Agent Amnesia & Debugging Loops

When coding agents (Claude, Cursor, Codex, Gemini) hit a project-specific failure, they repeatedly fall into known traps:
1. **Looping through already-disproven hypotheses** because they have no negative memory of what failed earlier in the session or in past commits.
2. **Re-inventing fragile workarounds** for errors that were already solved and verified by a developer weeks ago.
3. **Context window bloat** caused by generic memory dumps that inject paragraphs of irrelevant terminal noise on every prompt.

**Rewind** solves this with **evidence-qualified failure memory + selective recall + disciplined abstention**:
* **Evidence Before Memory:** A fix is not canon until it passes a verified test command (`exit 0`).
* **Negative Memory:** Remembers disproven fixes so agents never attempt the same bad change twice.
* **Disciplined Abstention:** If no qualified, compatible remedy exists, Rewind stays completely silent (`SILENCE`). No hallucinations, no prompt noise.
* **Zero Host Risk:** Rewind never executes arbitrary commands inside MCP or background hooks. Verification commands require explicit host/user approval.

### 1. 3-Tier Capture Policy
Rewind filters noise before it touches your permanent ledger:
- **`DISCARD`**: User cancellations (Ctrl+C / SIGINT 130) are immediately dropped.
- **`OBSERVE`**: Missing commands (127), typos, and transient slips enter a lightweight 30-minute rolling observation cache. If they recur within 30 minutes, they are promoted.
- **`PROMOTE`**: Test runner failures (`pytest`, `npm test`, `cargo test`, `jest`, `vitest`), compiler diagnostics (`file:line`), runtime stack traces, and OOM kills (137) are immediately promoted to the forensic ledger.

### 2. Selective Recall & Abstention
Rewind does not dump full terminal logs on your agent. On recurring commands, it evaluates:
- **Environment compatibility**: Did the compiler version, Node version, or git branch drift?
- **Disproven approaches**: Did a previous attempt with this hypothesis fail?
- **Decision outcome**:
  - `SURFACE`: Emits a concise 1-2 line reminder of the verified fix.
  - `CAUTION`: Warns against known failed attempts or warns of environment drift.
  - `SILENCE`: Produces zero output if no qualified remedy exists.

### 3. Safe Verification Protocol
- Historical fixes store a deterministic verification command (`verifyCmd`).
- The MCP tool `rewind_request_verification` returns a structured verification plan (`REQUIRES_HOST_APPROVAL`) with `readOnlyHint: true` and `openWorldHint: false`.
- Rewind **never** autonomously executes verification commands through MCP. Verification execution is strictly mediated by the host or triggered manually via `rewind verify <id>`.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Installation
Install globally via npm:
```bash
npm install -g rewind-cli
```

### 2. Guided Setup
In your project repository, run:
```bash
rewind setup
```
This automatically:
- Initializes `.rewind/` with an append-only JSONL journal and SQLite projection.
- Generates `.cursor/rules/rewind.mdc` and `.cursor/mcp.json` for Cursor.
- Generates `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI.
- Generates `AGENTS.md` for Codex and other agent harnesses.
- Configures non-blocking failure capture hooks.

*(To preview changes without writing files, run `rewind setup --dry-run`)*.

## 🤖 AI Agent Integration

### MCP Server
Rewind exposes a high-performance, zero-dependency [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server.

Start the server:
```bash
rewind mcp
```

#### Profiles: Core vs Full
To save agent context tokens, use `--profile core` to expose only the 4 essential failure-recovery tools:
```bash
rewind mcp --profile core
```
* **Core Profile (4 tools):**
  - `rewind_context`: Fetch forensic diagnostic context, verified remedies, and failed approaches.
  - `rewind_recover`: Submit a proposed hypothesis, fix, and verification command.
  - `rewind_request_verification`: Request host-approved verification plan (safe; does not execute).
  - `rewind_search`: Query past failures and fixes by keyword or error snippet.
* **Full Profile (8 tools):** Adds `rewind_history`, `rewind_doctor`, `rewind_patterns`, and `rewind_show`.

#### Claude Desktop Configuration
Add to `claude_desktop_config.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "rewind": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "rewind-cli", "mcp", "--profile", "core"],
      "env": {
        "REWIND_ROOT": "/absolute/path/to/your/project"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Cursor Integration
Add to `.cursor/mcp.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "rewind": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "rewind-cli", "mcp", "--profile", "core"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Ambient Agent Event Gateway
Agents can pipe tool execution failure payloads directly into Rewind via standard input:
```bash
rewind event --json < event.json
# or
rewind event --json --data '{"event":"postToolUseFailure","command":"npm test","exitCode":1,"error":"AssertionError"}'
```
Supports event schemas from **Cursor** (`postToolUseFailure`), **Gemini CLI** (`AfterTool`), **Codex** (`PostToolUse`), and generic JSON. Outputs structured `additionalContext` for immediate agent feedback.

## 🛡️ Security & Privacy Invariants

1. **Zero External Dependencies:** Built entirely with Node.js standard libraries and Node's native SQLite engine. No supply-chain bloat.
2. **Automatic Secret Redaction:** API keys, AWS tokens, bearer credentials, and environment passwords are automatically scrubbed from captured logs and memory snapshots before storage.
3. **No Unsanitized Auto-Execution:** Rewind will **never** automatically execute historical commands. Verification commands are executed only through explicit host/user initiation (`rewind verify <id>`).
4. **100% Local Storage:** Everything lives inside your local `.rewind` directory. No telemetry, no external API calls, no third-party data leaks.
